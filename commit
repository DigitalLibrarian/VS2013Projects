Arena mode beginnings

* Added Arena mode, which is currently just a site factory that generates site-sized rooms without doors.
* Added reaper death action reporting
* Changed symbol for floors to space, and modified structure factory to swap foreground and background colors.  It makes more sense to show floors as the background color
* ScreenLoadingMenuScreen is meant to be the new top level screen.  Currently it just allows a single selection and exits.
